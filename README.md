# Tears of the Recipes

this was going to be a simple recipe app for tears of the kingdom since i am tired of bloated ad filled sites. currently scrapes all the materials (minus the pumpkin (from a quest)) and stores it. could just be a json obj for a frontend only app. aiming to have ui let you pick each material and show possible recipes or pick boost and have max options available. currently paused since i'm not sure if i want to write custom logic to scrape existing recipes (all sites use varying language) or just manually create them (ugh).
